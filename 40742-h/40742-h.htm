<h3>
<span>STONE-PILLAR WORSHIP STILL EXISTING IN IRELAND.</span>
</h3>

<p>In a work recently published by the Earl of Roden, entitled <i>Progress of
the Reformation in Ireland</i>, there occurs a curious account of a remnant
of this ancient form of fetichism still existing in Inniskea, an island
off the coast of Mayo, with about 380 inhabitants amongst whom, he says,</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"<i>A stone</i> carefully wrapped up in flannel is brought out at
   certain periods to be adored; and when a storm arises, this god
   is supplicated to send a wreck on their coast."</p>

<p class="author1">P. 51.</p>


<p class="noindent">A correspondent in the same volume writes to Lord Roden that&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"They all speak the Irish language, and among them is a trace of
   that government by chiefs, which in former times prevailed in
   Ireland: the present chief or king of Inniskea is an intelligent
   peasant called C<span class="smcap lowercase">AIN</span>, whose authority is acknowledged, and the
   settlement of all disputes is referred to his decision. Though
   nominally Roman Catholics, these islanders have no priest
   resident among them; they know nothing of the tenets of that
   church, and their worship consists in occasional meetings at
   their chief's house, with visits to a holy well called <i>Derivla</i>.
   The absence of religion is supplied by the open practice of pagan
   idolatry. In the south island a stone idol called in the Irish
   <i>Neevougi</i>, has been from time immemorial religiously preserved
   and worshipped. This god resembles in appearance a thick roll of
   homespun flannel, which arises from the custom of dedicating to
   it a dress of that material whenever its aid is sought; this is
   sewed on by an old woman, its priestess. Of the early history of
   this idol no authentic information can be procured, but its power
   is believed to be immense; they pray to it in time of sickness,
   it is invoked when a storm is desired to dash some hapless ship
   upon their coast, and again it is solicited to calm the waves to
   admit of the islanders fishing or visiting the main land."</p>

<p class="author1"><i>Ib.</i>
   pp. 53, 54.</p>

<p>This statement, irrespective of graver reflections, is suggestive of
curious inquiry, whether this point of Ireland, on the utmost western
verge of Europe, be not the last spot in Christendom in which a trace
can now be found of stone-pillar worship?&mdash;the most ancient of all forms
of idolatry known to the records of the human race; and the most widely
extended, since at one time or another it has prevailed in every nation
of the old world, from the shores of Lapland to the confines of India;
and, I apprehend, vestiges of its former existence are to be traced on
the continent of America.</p>

<p>Before men discovered the use of metals, or the method of cutting rocks,
they worshipped unhewn stones; and if the authenticity of Sanchoniathon
is to be accepted, they consecrated pillars to the <i>fire</i> and the <i>wind</i>
before they had learned to hunt, to<a id="Page_122"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[122]</span> fish, or to harden bricks in
the sun. (Sanchon. in Cory's <i>Ancient Fragments</i>, pp. 7, 8.) From
<i>Chna</i>, "the first Ph&oelig;nician" as he is called by the same remote
authority, the Canaanites acquired the practice of stone-pillar worship,
which prevailed amongst them long before:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"Jacob took the stone that he had put for his pillow, and set it
   up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it and called the
   name of the place Bethel, saying, this stone which I have set up
   for a pillar shall be <i>God's house</i>."</p>

<p class="author1">Gen. xxviii. 18. 22.</p>

<p>The Israelites were repeatedly ordered to destroy these stone idols of
the Canaanites, to overthrow their altars, and "break their pillars"
(Deut. vii. 5.; xii. 3.). And when the Jews themselves, in their
aberrations, were tempted to imitate their customs, Moses points a
sarcasm at their delusion:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "Where are their gods; their <i>rock</i> in whom they trusted! How
   should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight,
   except their <i>rock</i> had sold them?"</p>

<p class="author1"><i>Ib.</i> xxxii. 30. 37.</p>

<p>From Jacob's consecration of his stone pillar, and the name <i>Bethel</i>
which he conferred upon it (which, in Ph&oelig;nician, signified <i>the house
of God</i>), were derived the Bætylia, <span title="[Greek: Baitylia]">&#914;&#945;&#953;&#964;&#8059;&#955;&#953;&#945;</span> or
 <span title="[Greek: Baityloi]">&#914;&#945;&#953;&#964;&#8059;&#955;&#959;&#953;</span>, the black stones worshipped in Syria and Asia Minor, in
Egypt, and in Greece before the time of Cecrops, under the names of
Cybele and of Saturn, who is fabled to have swallowed one of them when
he intended to have devoured his son Jupiter. Even in the refined period
of Grecian philosophy, the common people could not divest themselves of
the influence of the ancient belief; and Theophrastus gives it as the
characteristic of the "superstitious man," that he could not resist the
impulse to bow to these mysterious stones, which served to mark the
confluence of the highways. From Asia Minor pillar worship was carried
to Italy and Gaul, and eventually extended to Germany, where the trunks
of trees occasionally became the substitute for stone. From the same
original the Arabs borrowed the Kaaba, the black stone, which is still
revered at Mecca; and the Brahmans a more repulsive form, under which
the worship now exists in Hindostan. Even in early times the reverence
of these stones took a variety of forms as they were applied to mark the
burial-place of saints and persons of distinction, to define contested
boundaries, and to commemorate great events (vide Joshua iv. 5.; xxiv.
26.); and perhaps many of the stones which have now a traditional, and
even historical celebrity in Great Britain, such as the "Lia Fail" of
Tara, the great "Stone of Scoon," on which the Scottish kings were
crowned; the "King's Stone" in Surrey, which served a similar office to
the Saxons; the "Charter Stone" of Inverness; the "Leper's Stone" of
Ayr; the "Blue Stone" of Carrick; the "Black Stone" of Iona, and others,
may have acquired their later respect from their earlier sanctity.</p>

<p>There appear to be few countries in the old world which do not possess
some monuments of this most remote idolatry; but there is none in which
they would seem to be so abundant as on the western extremity of Europe,
in Cornwall, and especially in the islands and promontories from the
Land's End to Caithness and the Orkneys. In the latter the worship of
stone pillars continued to so recent a period, that one is curious to
know when it actually disappeared, and whether there still exist traces
of it in any other locality, similar to that pointed out by the Earl of
Roden at Inniskea.</p>

<p>My own acquaintance with the subject is very imperfect; but, so far as
my recollection serves, the following references may direct attention to
interesting quarters.</p>

<p>Scheffer, who published his <i>Description of Lapland</i> in 1673, states
that the practice of stone-pillar worship then existed there, and that
<i>Storjunkar</i>, one of the deities of Scandinavian mythology, was&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">Represented by a stone. Neither do they use any art in polishing
   it; but take it as they find it upon the banks of lakes and
   rivers. In this shape they worship it as his image, and call it
   <i>Kied kie jubmal</i>, that is, <i>the stone god</i>."</p>

<p class="author1">Scheffer,
   <i>Lapponia</i>. Engl. London, 1751.</p>

<p>He adds that they select the unhewn stone, because it is in the form in
which it was shaped by the hand of the Creator himself. The incident
suggests a curious coincidence with the expressions of Isaiah (ch. lvii.
v. 6.):</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion; they, they
   are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink-offering; thou
   hast offered a meat-offering. Should I receive comfort in these?"</p>

<p>Joshua, too, selected the twelve stones with which he commemorated the
passage of the Jordan from the midst of the river, where the priests'
feet stood when they bore the ark across.</p>

<p>Martin, in his account of the Western Islands of Scotland
 in 1703 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>,
describes repeatedly the numerous pillar-stones which were then objects
of respect in the several localities. And in one instance he states that
an image which was held in veneration in one of the islands was <i>swathed
in flannel</i>,&mdash;a practice which would thus seem to have served as a
precedent for the priestess of Inniskea, as detailed by Lord Roden. In
speaking of the island of Eriska, to the north of Barra, Martin says&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">"There is a stone set up, near a mile to the south of St.
   Columbus's church, about eight foot high and two broad. It is
   called by the natives the <i>bowing stone</i>; for when the
   inhabitants had the first sight of the church, they set up this
   stone, and then bowed, and said the Lord's Prayer."</p>

<p class="author1"><i>A Description of the Western Islands</i>, p. 88.</p>

<p>But Borlase, who notices this passage in his<a id="Page_123"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[123]</span> <i>Antiquities of
Cornwall</i>, gives a much more learned derivation of the name. He says:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"They call them <i>bowing stones</i>, as it seems to me, from the
   reverence shown them; for the <i>Even Maschith</i>, which the Jews
   were forbade to worship&mdash;(Leviticus xxvi. 1. '<i>neither shall ye
   set up any image of stone</i>')&mdash;signifies really a <i>bowing stone</i>,
   and was doubtless so called because worshipped by the
   Canaanites."</p>

<p class="author1">Borlase, <i>Antiquities of Cornwall</i>, book iii. c. 2.</p>


<p>I fancy the word which Martin rendered a <i>bowing stone</i>, is <i>cromlech</i>,
or <i>crom liagh</i>.</p>

<p>As regards the ancient monuments of stone worship in Cornwall, the most
learned and the most ample information is contained in Borlase's
<i>Antiquities</i> of that county; but there their worship ceased, though not
till several centuries after the introduction of Christianity. Borlase
says:</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "After Christianity took place, many continued to worship these
   stones; coming thither with lighted torches, and praying for
   safety and success: and this custom we can trace through the
   fifth and sixth centuries; and even into the seventh, as will
   appear from the prohibitions of several Councils."</p>

<p class="author1">Borlase, <i>Antiq. Corn.</i>, b. iii. c. ii. p. 162.</p>

<p>In all parts of Ireland these stone pillars are to be found in
comparative frequency. Accounts of them will be found in <i>The Ancient
and Present State of the County Down</i>, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>/sc> 1744; in Wakeman's <i>Handbook
of Irish Antiquities</i>, and in various similar authorities. A writer in
the <i>Archæologia</i> for <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 1800 says that many of the stone crosses
which form so interesting and beautiful a feature in Irish antiquities
were originally pagan pillar-stones, on which the cross was sculptured
subsequent to the introduction of Christianity, in order that&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "The common people, who were not easily to be diverted from their
   superstitious reverence for these stones, might pay a kind of
   justifiable adoration to them when thus appropriated to the use
   of Christian memorials by the sign of the cross."</p>

<p class="author1"><i>Archæol.</i>    vol. xiii. p. 208.</p>

<p>The tenacity of the Irish people to this ancient superstition is
established by the fact of its continuance to the present day in the
sequestered island of Inniskea. And it seems to me that it would be an
object of curious inquiry, if your correspondents could ascertain
whether this be the last remnant of pillar worship now remaining in
Europe; and especially whether any further trace of it is to be found in
any other portion of the British dominions.</p>

<p>A great many correspondents of the daily press are directing the
attention, I suppose, of the Government to what they call the
"defenceless state of Great Britain." Will you allow me, on account, as
I think, of its rarity, to submit to you the following extract from the

<h3>
<span>HERMITS, ORNAMENTAL AND EXPERIMENTAL.</span>
</h3>


<p>Keeping a poet is a luxury enjoyed by many, from the Queen down to
Messrs. Moses, Hyam and Co.; but the refinement of keeping an hermit
would appear to be a more <i>recherché</i> and less ordinary appendage of
wealth and taste.</p>

<p>I send you an advertisement <i>for</i>, and two actual instances of <i>going a
hermiting</i>, from my scrapbook:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "A young man, who wishes to retire from the world and live as an
   hermit in some convenient spot in England, is willing to engage
   with any nobleman or gentleman who may be desirous of having one.
   Any letter directed to S. Lawrence (post paid) to be left at Mr.
   Otton's, No. 6. Colman's Lane, Plymouth, mentioning what gratuity
   will be given, and all other particulars, will be duly attended
   to."</p>

    <p class="author1"><i>Courier</i>, Jan. 11th, 1810.</p>

<p>Can any one tell me whether this retiring young<a id="Page_124"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[124]</span> man was engaged
in the above capacity? I do not think so: for soon after an
advertisement appeared in the papers which I have reasons for thinking
was by the same hand.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"Wants a situation in a pious regular family, in a place where
   the Gospel is preached, a young man of serious mind, who can wait
   at table and milk a cow."</p>

<p>The immortal Dr. Busby asks&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

   <p>"When energising objects men pursue,</p>
   <p>What are the prodigies they cannot do?"</p>

</div>

<p>Whether it is because <i>going a hermiting</i> does not come under the
Doctor's "energising objects" I know not; but this is clear, that the
two following instances proved unsuccessful:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "M. Hamilton, once the proprietor of Payne's Hill, near Cobham,
   Surrey, advertised for a person who was willing to become a
   hermit in that beautiful retreat of his. The conditions were,
   that he was to continue in the hermitage seven years, where he
   should be provided with a Bible, optical glasses, a mat for his
   bed, a hassock for his pillow, an hour-glass for his timepiece,
   water for his beverage, food from the house, but never to
   exchange a syllable with the servant. He was to wear a camlet
   robe, never to cut his beard or nails, nor ever to stray beyond
   the limits of the grounds. If he lived there, under all these
   restrictions, till the end of the term, he was to receive seven
   hundred guineas. But on breach of any of them, or if he quitted
   the place any time previous to that term, the whole was to be
   forfeited. One person attempted it, but a three weeks' trial
   cured him.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">  "Mr. Powyss, of Marcham, near Preston, Lancashire, was more
   successful in this singularity: he advertised a reward of 50<i>l.</i>
   a-year for life, to any man who would undertake to live seven
   years under ground, without seeing anything human: and to let his
   toe and finger nails grow, with his hair and beard, during the
   whole time. Apartments were prepared under ground, very
   commodious, with a cold bath, a chamber organ, as many books as
   the occupier pleased, and provisions served from his own table.
   Whenever the recluse wanted any convenience, he was to ring a
   bell, and it was provided for him. Singular as this residence may
   appear, an occupier offered himself, and actually staid in it,
   observing the required conditions for four years."</p>

<h3>
<span>DAVID MALLET, HIS CHARACTER AND BIOGRAPHY.</span>
</h3>

<p>When an editor selects a favourite ballad for notes and illustrations,
he may be supposed, naturally, to have a sort of respect, not to say
veneration, for its author. Such is the case with the recent editor of
<i>Edwin and Emma</i> (Dr. Dinsdale), when, in his brief biography of David
Mallet, he glosses over the vices of this man's character in the
quietest and most inoffensive manner possible. If he was a "heartless
villain" I do not see that we ought to screen him; and I think those who
may choose to look into his doings will find him full as "black" as he
is painted.</p>

<p>Southey, in his <i>Specimens of the Later English Poets</i>, vol. ii. p.
342., does not mince the matter. His words are these:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"A man of more talents than honesty, who was always ready to
   perform any dirty work for interest; to blast the character
   either of the dead or the living, and to destroy life as well as
   reputation. Mallet was 'first assassin' in the tragedy of Admiral
   Byng's murder."</p>


<p>In a copy of Gascoigne's <i>Works</i>, sold in Heber's sale, was the
following MS. note by George Steevens:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"This volume was bought for 1<i>l.</i> 13<i>s.</i> at Mr. Mallet's <i>alias</i>
   Malloch's, sale, March 14, 1776. He was the only Scotchman who
   died in my memory unlamented by an individual of his own nation."</p>

<p>David Malloch, or Mallet, is said to have been born about the year 1700,
at Crieff, in Perthshire, at which place his father was an innkeeper. A
search has been made in the parochial registers of Crieff, from 1692 to
1730, but his baptism is not registered.</p>

<p>The names of various children of Charles and Donald Malloch's in the
neighbourhood of Crieff occur, including a David, in 1712. This
obviously was not the poet; but it appears that his father "James
Malloch, and Beatrix Clark his wife," were brought before the Kirk
Session of Crieff in October and November, 1704, for profanation of the
Lord's day, "by some strangers drinking and fighting in their house on
the Sabbath immediately following Michaelmas." On the 12th of November,
"they being both rebuked for giving entertainment to such folks on the
sabbath-day, and promising never to do the like, were dismissed."</p>

<p>Some of Mallet's letters are printed in the <i>Edinburgh Magazine</i>, a
literary miscellany, for 1793. They contain a number of curious literary
notices, including some particulars of the writer's life not generally
known.</p>

<p>Much interesting matter concerning the literary career and character of
David Mallet may also be found in the recent <i>Life of David Hume</i> by
John Hill Burton, Esq., Advocate.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>The Hyphen.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Dr. Dobbin, lecturing some time back on physical
education in Hull, condemned the practice of tight lacing as extremely
injurious to the symmetry and health of the female sex, and jocularly
proposed the formation of an
"Anti-killing-young-women-by-a-lingering-death-Society." This was
gravely reproduced in other parts of this country and on the continent
as sober matter of fact, the Germans giving the hyphenated title thus:

<h4>
<span><i>Old Books New Titles.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Permit me to say that it is in the power of
your London correspondents to do a real service to your country readers,
and at the same time serve the cause of <i>honest</i> bibliopoly, by pointing
out in the pages of "N. &amp; Q." current instances of what I beg leave to
call <i>the fraudulent advertisement</i> of published books under a <i>new
title</i>, or one so altered as to produce the impression of <i>novelty</i> in
the mind of a reader like myself. For example, being an admirer of <i>Sam
Slick's</i> works&mdash;and who is not?&mdash;I purchased, on its first appearance,
his <i>English in America</i>; and seeing lately advertised, as a new work,
<i>Rule and Misrule of the English in America</i>, by the same author, I
obtained it, and found it the identical work before named, the
<i>title-page</i> alone being altered! I mention another instance. I perceive
an advertisement of the <i>Letters of Gray the Poet</i>, published from the
original MSS. in two volumes, by the Rev. J. Mitford. Now, I should like
to know whether this is, as it is called, really a "new work," or merely
a part, or at most a revival, of Mitford's <i>Letters, &amp;c. of Gray</i>,
published in 4 vols., 1836.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Eugene Aram.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Until the year 1834, when considerable reforms took
place in the Court of Exchequer with respect to sheriffs' accounts, a
process called "the Summons of the Pipe" issued into each county,
charging the sheriff with the levy of divers old rents. In that of
Yorkshire I noticed the following entry, which I communicated to Mr.
Scatcherd. I am not aware that it has ever been published. By inserting
it you will relieve me from the necessity of preserving my "note."</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Of the same Sheriff for the issues of waste building in
   Knaresbrough, in the said county, in the tenure of Daniel Clarke,
   of the yearly value of <span class="smcap lowercase">IIII</span>£i and one undivided moiety or fifth
   part of the whole, to be divided into five equal parts of and in
   a certain farm called Moat House farm, situate at Wickersley in
   the said County, which consists [<i>here followed particulars</i>], in
   the occupation of Samuel Chipchase, of the yearly value of <span class="smcap lowercase">XXI</span>£i
   of the lands and tenements of <i>Daniel Clarke</i> aforesaid,
   shoemaker, <i>outlawed</i> at the suit of <i>Philip Coates</i>, gentleman,
   in a plea of trespass on the case <span class="smcap lowercase">VIII</span>£i III<span class="topnum">s</span> and

 arrears."</p>


<p>"Philip Coates," says Mr. Scatcherd (<i>Gleanings</i>, p. 26.),
"attorney-at-law, a very respectable man, married Clarke's wife's
sister." It is singular that a murdered man should be outlawed after
death and that he should continue to haunt the Exchequer for near a
century afterwards. It is a complete confirmation of the statement that
Clarke was supposed to have absconded, and that no suspicion of foul
play arose at the time of his disappearance.</p>

<h3>
<span>JUNIUS QUERIES.</span>
</h3>

<h4>
<span><i>Junius Rumours.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Some months since there was a story whispered in
certain circles, or rather two stories, which, when taken together, went
to show that this great mystery of modern times was on the eve of
solution. The first stated that the <i>Grenville Papers</i>, about to be
published by Murray, would prove the identity of Junius with the
correspondent of Woodfall under one of the signatures Atticus or Brutus,
whose letters had been already, and, as it would thereby appear, very
properly, attributed to Junius himself. The second rumour was to the
effect that an eminent bookseller, whose attention had been drawn to the
Junius question by the circumstance of his having recently published an
edition of the letters, &amp;c., on being called in to estimate the value of
certain historical papers for some legal purposes, was startled by
discovering, in the course of his examination of them, who this Atticus
or Brutus was&mdash;and, consequently, who Junius himself was. On the
announcement of an article on Junius in the <i>Quarterly Review</i>, those
who had heard these stories expected to find in the article in question
the solution of what has been called the "great political enigma of the
eighteenth century." As this hope has not been realised, may I ask,
through the medium of "N. &amp; Q.," whether there is any foundation for the
rumours I have referred to; and, if so, how much of truth there is in
both or either of them. Such information will be acceptable to every one
of your readers who is not satisfied with any of the T<span class="smcap lowercase">HIRTY</span>-N<span class="smcap lowercase">INE</span>
theories on the subject which have been already propounded, and who is
therefore like myself still a</p>

   <p class="right">    J<span class="smcap lowercase">UNIUS</span> Q<span class="smcap lowercase">UERIST</span>.</p>



<h4>
<span><i>"To Commit" in the Sense used by Junius.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;On looking into Walker's
<i>Dictionary</i>, a short time since, I found the following remark, which
seems to have escaped every inquirer into the authorship of the letters
of Junius:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "<i>To</i> C<span class="smcap lowercase">OMMIT</span>.&mdash;This word was <i>first</i> used in Junius's letters in
   a sense unknown to our former English writers, namely, <i>to
   expose</i>, <i>to venture</i>, <i>to hazard</i>; this sense is borrowed from
   the French, and has been generally adopted by subsequent
   writers."</p>

<p>Can any of your readers produce an instance of the use of this word in
the sense here applied to it, <i>prior</i> to the appearance of Junius? Such
a parallel would carry more weight with it than the countless examples
of verbal singularities with<a id="Page_126"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[126]</span> which almost every <i>discoverer</i> of
Junius has encumbered his essay.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Junius' letters to Wilkes.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Would M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. H<span class="smcap lowercase">ALLAM</span> kindly inform your
readers whether the <i>Junius Letters</i>, to which he refers in "N. &amp; Q."
Vol. iii., p. 241., were inserted in books or not? And in the former
case, whether they were in a separate collection, or mixed with the
other correspondence of Mr. Wilkes?</p>

  <p class="right">  I. J. M.</p>




<h3>
<span>WHAT IS THE DERIVATION OF "GARSECG?"</span>
</h3>

<p>This Anglo-Saxon word is used in the poetry of Beowulf and Cædmon, and
in the prose of Orosius and Bede, &amp;c. The <i>â</i> in <i>gâr</i> is twice accented
in Cædmon; and Mr. Kemble has always accented it in Beowulf. In the
Lauderdale MS. of Orosius it is written <i>garsæcg</i> and <i>garsecg</i>; and in
the Cotton MS. <i>garsegc</i> and <i>garsecg</i>, without any accent. Grimm,
Kemble, and Ettmüller make the first past of the word to be <i>gâr</i>, a
spear, javelin, the Goth., <i>gairu</i>; Ohd., <i>kér</i>; O. Sax., <i>gér</i>; O.
Nor., <i>geir</i>: and the latter, <i>secg</i>, a soldier, man. Thus <i>gârsecg</i>
would be literally "a spear-man," homo jaculo armatus. Mr. Kemble adds,
it is "a name for <i>the ocean</i>, which is probably derived from some
ancient myth, and is now quite unintelligible." Ettmüller gives it,
"<i>Gârsecg, es</i>, m. Carex jaculorum, vel vir hastatus, <i>i.e.</i>
oceanus.&mdash;Grymn's <i>Mythol.</i>, p. xxvii."</p>

<p>Dahlmann, in his <i>Forschungen der Geschichte</i>, p. 414., divides the word
thus: <i>Gars-ecg</i>, and says, <i>gar</i> is very expressive, and denotes "what
is enclosed," and is allied to the Ger. <i>garten</i>, a garden, like the
A.-S. <i>geard</i>, a garden, region, earth. <i>Ecg</i>, Icl. <i>egg</i>; Ger. <i>egge</i>,
<i>ecke</i>, a border, an outward part; that is, <i>what borders or encircles
the earth, the ocean</i>. What authority is there for dividing the word
into <i>gars-ecg</i>, and for the meaning he gives to <i>gar</i>?</p>

<p>Barrington, in his edition of <i>Orosius</i>, p. xxiii., gives "M. H. The
Patton MS." among the transcripts. I cannot find any Hatton MS. of
<i>Orosius</i>. Can he refer to the transcript of Junius?</p>

<span><i>Pedigree of Richard, Earl of Chepstow.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;At a recent meeting of the
Kilkenny Archæological Society, there was exhibited, by permission of
the Marquis of Ormonde, an original charter, under seal, of Richard,
Earl of Chepstow, surnamed Strongbow, whereby he granted certain lands
in his newly acquired territory of Leinster, to Adam de Hereford. The
charter, which is beautifully and clearly written on a small piece of
vellum, commences thus:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Comes Ric' fil' com' Ric' Gisleb'ti omnibus amicis suis," &amp;c.</p>

<p class="noindent">As the usually given pedigrees (see Sir R. Colt Hoare's <i>Tour in
Ireland</i>, Introd. p. lxxv.) make Richard Strongbow the son of Gilbert,
the second son, and not Richard, the eldest son, of Gilbert de Tonbrige;
query, Are we to supply "fil'" before "Gisleberti" in the charter, or
are we to suppose that the second "Ric'" is a slip of the pen,&mdash;a thing,
however, not likely to occur in a legal deed of so important a nature.</p>

<span><i>Braem's "Mémoires touchant le Commerce."</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Having lately seen a MS., of
which I subjoin the title, and not being able to discover any further
account of the writer of it than what is briefly given in the volume
itself, I submit my wish to know something more about the author, and
his,<a id="Page_127"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[127]</span> perhaps, still inedited work, to you and to your numerous
readers, both in England and in Holland (where you have an able
imitator), in the hope of gaining some further information about him.
The MS. is a foolscap folio, containing about 340 pages, written in a
bold, open hand, and bears the following title: <i>Mémoires touchant le
Commerce que les Provinces Unies des Pays-Bas font dans les divers
Endroits du Monde</i>. At page 306. this part of the MS. ends, and is
signed by "Daniel Braems," who says of himself, that he left the Dutch
possessions in the East Indies in 1686, and made his Report to the
States-General of what he had seen, and delivered in a written copy. Mr.
Braems says farther, that he was "dernièrement Teneur-Général des Livres
à Batavie, et a ramené en qualité de Commandeur la dernière Flotte des
Indes en ce pays;" and that his Report, as regards East India affairs,

<span><i>Family of Bullen.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Could any of your readers inform me what branch of
the Bullen family it was that emigrated to Ireland in the fifteenth or
sixteenth century, and settled at Kinsale in the county of Cork? Their
genealogical history I find it difficult, almost impossible, to
discover. It is thought that the first of the family who settled in
Ireland was nearly allied to the lovely but unfortunate queen of Henry
VIII.; and the family consequently claim kindred with our famous Queen
Elizabeth, though they seem unable to trace their pedigree so as to
prove it. The present representative of this old family resides at Bally
Thomas, in the neighbourhood of Mallow; but, singular to say, though
proud of his name and race, can give no correct history of his pedigree;
in fact, nothing more than a traditionary account of it. I find, in
turning over the pages of Burke's <i>Landed Gentry</i>, the following note
appended to the pedigree of the Glovers of Mount Glover:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "This Abigail Bullen was daughter of Robert Bullen, of Kinsale,
   descended from the Bullen family, who came and settled in Ireland
   in the reign of Elizabeth, and who are stated to have been not
   remotely related to that queen."</p>

<p>Any information connected with this family I am most anxious to obtain.</p>

Winton, sent by Thomas Cooper, the Bishop of Winton, 1587, to the Lord

<p>In the first place, there appears to be some misprint, as "the whole

and allowances deducted" 3389<i>l.</i> 0<i>s.</i> 11<i>d.</i>, and then "remain of rent
of assize of the same bishopric" 2773<i>l.</i> 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, which appears
afterwards to be a misprint for 2775<i>l.</i>, &amp;c. What is "rent of assize?"
is it the <i>assessment</i> of the bishopric for dues, rates, &amp;c.? Also what
is the meaning of "ob. q.," which is added after certain items?</p>

<span><i>White Livers.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;Can any correspondent give some information as to the

alludes to it in any way. In a recent account of poisonings in France,
by a woman Named Helène Jagado, it<a id="Page_128"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[128]</span> is stated that though for a
long time she was not suspected to be an actual murderess, yet "the
frequency of deaths in the families by whom she was engaged excited a
suspicion among the peasantry that there was something in her nature
fatal to those who were near her; and they said that <i>her liver was
white</i>, it being believed, in that part of France, that persons who are
dangerous have <i>white livers</i>." In the midland counties there is a
similar saying among the lower classes, and I have heard it said of an
individual who had married and lost several wives by death, that he had
a white liver. A young woman once told me that she had been advised not
to marry a certain suitor, because he had a white liver, and she would
be dead within a year. "White-livered rascal" is a common term of
reproach in Gloucestershire. What is the origin and explanation of the
supposed <i>white liver</i>?</p>

<span><i>Story of Ginevra.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Mr. Rogers, in his beautiful poem of <i>Italy</i>, has a
story which is headed "Ginevra," and which he lays the scene of at
Modena. It narrates that a young bride on the day of her wedding, to
entertain her young friends, proposes that they should amuse themselves
at "hide-and-seek;" and thinking to conceal herself where her companions
could not discover her, bethought herself of an old oaken chest in the
garret of the house. The lid of this chest unfortunately had a clasp
lock, which occasioned her to be completely enshrined; and not being
discovered at the time, she must have perished miserably. Many years
after, upon pulling the house down the chest was forced open, and the
skeleton of the unfortunate lady was, to the consternation of all
present, brought to light.</p>

<p>Mr. Rogers, in a note, says, "I believe this story to be founded on
fact, though I cannot tell when and where it happened;" and adds, "many
old houses <i>in this country</i> lay claim to it."</p>

<p>I should be much obliged to any reader of the "N. &amp; Q." to point out any
old seat in England where the above is stated to have happened; if there
be any memorial or legend concerning it, or any particulars relating to
it.</p>

<h3>
<span>THE THREE ESTATES OF THE REALM.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 278.)</span>
</h3>


<p>M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. F<span class="smcap lowercase">RASER'S</span> erudite researches are well worth the space which they
occupy. The conclusions to<a id="Page_130"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[130]</span> be drawn from them appear quite to
support my positions:</p>

<p>1. <i>The Three Estates of the Realm are, the Spiritualty, the Nobility,
and the Commonalty</i>: on this fact there is no dispute. The last is as
certainly the <i>third</i> estate (<i>tiers état</i>). But M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. F<span class="smcap lowercase">RASER</span> demurs to my
ranking the Spiritual Estate as the <i>first</i>, quoting the Collect in the
Service for the fifth of November, which runs, "the Nobility, Clergy,
and Commonalty." On this point I am not prepared with a decisive
authority; but certainly the language and practice of Parliament is with
me. The Lords Spiritual are always named <i>before</i> the Lords Temporal,
and precedence is allotted to them accordingly; the Archbishops ranking
<i>above</i> the Earls (with the more recent distinctions of Marquess and
Duke), and the Bishops <i>above</i> the Temporal Barons [Qy. What was the
relative rank of the <i>other</i> "prelates" who were formerly in
Parliament?]. To the same effect is the language of the celebrated
preamble to the act 24 Henry VIII. c. 12.:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "This realm of England is an empire ... governed by one supreme
   head and King ... unto whom a body politic compact of all sorts
   and degrees of people divided in terms and by names of
   <i>Spiritualty and Temporalty</i>, be bounden and owen."</p>

<p>2. <i>The Convocations of the Clergy</i> (which are <i>two</i> synods sitting in
three houses) <i>are no part of the Parliament</i>. M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> F<span class="smcap lowercase">RASER</span> thinks "this
point was settled somewhat late in our history;" but it is proved (I
submit) in the very extracts which he produces from ancient statutes.
Since there is no doubt that the Clergy sat <i>regularly</i> in Convocation,
we should not hear of their <i>occasional</i> presence in the House of
Commons had the Convocation been deemed a part of Parliament. It is
certain that Convocation never exercised the powers which belong to a
chamber of Parliament; even their own subsidies to the Crown were
ratified and passed in Parliament before they became <i>legally</i> binding.
[See on the whole of this subject, Burn's <i>Eccl. Law</i> (Phillimore's
ed.), tit. "Convocation," vol. ii. pp. 19-23.] M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> F<span class="smcap lowercase">RASER</span> has certainly
adduced instances in which the assent of the Clergy was given to
<i>particular</i> statutes; he might have added the recital of their
submission to the Crown, in the Act of Supremacy, 26 Henry VIII. c. 1.
He has shown also that clerical proctors were <i>occasionally</i> introduced
into the House of Commons, like the judges (he says) in the House of
Lords. But this is far from making those proctors, or the Convocation
which sent them, a <i>part</i> of the Parliament. Indeed it is shown that
they were <i>not</i> by the petition of the Lower House of Convocation (cited
by M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. F<span class="smcap lowercase">RASER</span>), in which they desire "<i>to be admitted to sit in
Parliament</i> with the House of Commons, according to antient usage." It
is clear that they who so petitioned did not esteem themselves to be, as
a Convocation, already part of the Parliament. The Convocation would
indeed have become the Spiritual Estate in Parliament, if the Clergy had
acceded to the wise and patriotic design of King Edward I. But they,
affecting an <i>imperium in imperio</i>, refused to assemble at the King's
writ as a portion of the Parliament of their country, and chose to tax
themselves apart in their Provincial Synods, where they used the forms
of a separate Parliament for the Church.</p>

<p>3. Hence <i>the Spiritual Estate was, and still is, represented in
Parliament by the Spiritual Lords</i>. William the Conqueror having
converted their sees into baronies, they were obliged, like other
tenants <i>in capite</i>, to obey the royal summons to <i>Parliament</i>. When I
called it a mistake to suppose that our Bishops sit in the Upper House
only as Barons, I did not mean that they are not so, in the present
constitution of Parliament, but that such was not the <i>origin</i> of the
prelates being called to share in the legislation of the realm. The
other clergy, however, retained their tenure of frankalmoigne, and stood
aloof alike from the councils and from the burdens of the state.
Attendance in Parliament being chiefly given for the purpose of voting
<i>taxes</i>, the Commons, as well as the Clergy, looked upon it as a burden
more than a privilege. But while the Clergy were quickly compelled to
bear their share of the public burdens, their short-sighted policy
deprived them of the voice which is now enjoyed by other degrees of
Englishmen in the affairs of the country. While Convocation was sitting,
the Clergy could make their sentiments known by the Bishops who
represented their Estate in Parliament; and we often find the Lower
House of Convocation petitioning their lordships to make statements of
this kind in their places in Parliament. But in the present suspension
of Convocation and the disuse of diocesan synods, the Clergy have lost
their weight with the Bishops themselves; and that once formidable
Estate of the Realm retains but the shadow of a representation in
<i>Parliament</i>.</p>

<p>M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. F<span class="smcap lowercase">RASER</span> will find this account of the matter fully borne out by the
extract he has given from Bennet's <i>Narrative</i>. "The King in full
Parliament charged the <i>Prelates</i>, Earls, Barons, and other great men,
and the Knights of the shire, and the Commons," to give him counsel.
Here we have a description of <i>Parliament</i> precisely as it is
constituted at this day, and the "Prelates" are the only members of the
Spiritualty. Then we read "the Prelates <i>deliberated</i> 'with the clergy
by themselves' (<i>i.e.</i> in <i>Convocation</i>), and the Earls and Barons by
themselves, and the Knights and others of the Commons by themselves; and
then, 'in full Parliament' (as before), each by themselves, and
afterwards all in common answered," <i>i.e.</i> the Clergy deliberated in
Convocation, but answered <i>in Parliament</i> by their Prelates.<a id="Page_131"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[131]</span></p>

<p>It is true, as M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. F<span class="smcap lowercase">RASER</span> observes, that the majority of the Upper House
of Parliament binds the Clergy though all the Bishops should be
dissentient, as in Queen Elizabeth's Act of Uniformity. This is the
result of the Spiritual Estate voting in the same chamber with the
Nobility; and to avoid such a result the Commons very early demanded a
chamber to themselves. The Spiritualty is thus yet further reduced under
the power of the Temporalty; for "the authority of Parliament" (as
Elizabeth's Act of Uniformity words it) is and must be supreme, however
defective its representative constitution. It were certainly to be
wished that those liberal reformers who were so shocked at <i>burgage
tenures</i> and rotten boroughs, would extend their compassion to the
disfranchised clergy, some five or six hundred of whom are
"represented," without their consent or opinion asked, by a prelate
appointed by the Crown.</p>

<p>On the whole, the Convocation is "the true Church of England by
representation" (Canon 139) in such matters as belong to the <i>Church</i> as
distinguished from the <i>State</i>; but in <i>Parliament</i>, which is the State,
the Spiritualty is represented by the Bishops alone.</p>

<p>I am astonished that M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. F<span class="smcap lowercase">RASER</span> should stumble at my remark, that the
Three Estates still assemble in common for the final passing of every
act. I had thought that the ceremony of giving the royal assent in full
Parliament to bills previously deliberated upon in the two Houses apart,
had been sufficiently well known.</p>

<p class="right">   C<span class="smcap lowercase">ANON</span> E<span class="smcap lowercase">BOR</span>.</p>


<p>P.S.&mdash;Since writing the above I have lighted upon the following
authorities, confirming the position that the Spiritual Estate is
represented in Parliament by the Bishops, and also that it is ranked as
the "<i>First</i> Estate of the Realm." Can M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> F<span class="smcap lowercase">RASER</span> adduce <i>any authority
whatever</i> for applying that designation to the Clergy in Convocation?</p>

<p>I. In <i>An Account of the Ceremonies observed at the Coronation of George
III.</i> (London, Kearsley, 1791, 4to.), I read that immediately after the
enthronement&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"The bishops performed their homage, and <i>then</i> the temporal
   lords, first H. R. H. the Duke of York, and H. R. H. the Duke of
   Cumberland, each for  himself;"&mdash;</p>

<p>the Prelates thus taking precedence even of the blood royal. The same
fact is distinctly stated in the accounts appended of the coronations of
James II., William and Mary (when the Bishops did homage before Prince
George); and I presume that this is the regular order in which the
Estates of the Realm do homage to the Sovereign upon that most solemn
occasion.</p>

<p>II. When the royal assent is given to any act of grace (which emanates
from the Crown in the first instance), the form is for the clerk of
parliament to acknowledge the royal favour in these words:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> III. "<i>Les prélats, seigneurs, et commons</i>, en ce present
   parliament assemblés au nom de tout vous autre subjects
   remercient très humblement votre Majesté, et prient à Dieu vous
   donner en santé bonne vie et longue."</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Strictly speaking, the 'Three Estates of the Realm' consist of,
   1st, the Lords Spiritual; 2nd, the Lords Temporal; 3rd, the
   Commons. Parliament fully assembled consists of the King, with
   the two estates of the Peerage sitting in one house, and the
   Commons by their representatives standing below the bar."</p>

<h3>
<span>LEGEND OF ST. KENELM&mdash;IN CLIENT COU BACHE.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 79.)</span>
</h3>

<p>Your correspondent will find the ample story in the <i>Golden Legend</i>. It
is related more succinctly by Roger of Wendover, who has been followed
by later chroniclers. In the legend, as related by Roger of Wendover,
the murder of Kenelm is said to have been miraculously notified at Rome
by a white dove alighting on the altar of St. Peter's church, bearing a
scroll in her bill, which she let fall. The scroll contained, among
other things, the following lines:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "In Clente cou bache</p>
     <p> Kenelm kine-bearn,</p>
      <p>Lith under thorne</p>
     <p> Havedes bereaved."</p>

</div>

   <p class="blockquot">"Qui Latine sonat (says the Chronicler) in pastum vaccarum
   Kenelmius regis filius jacet sub spina capite privatus."</p>

  <p class="author1"><i>MS.
   Douce</i>, fo. 66. <i>b.</i></p>


<p>And afterwards he says:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"De hujus quoque sancte martyris quidam sic ait:</p>
     <p> In Clent, sub spina, jacet in <i>convalle bovina</i>,</p>
      <p>Vertice privatus, Kenelmus rege creatus."</p>

</div>

<p>"Cou ba<i>c</i>he" has been erroneously printed "cou ba<i>t</i>he;" and travestied
sometimes into <i>coubage</i>.</p>

<p><i>Clent</i> is the name of the place, a wood according to the <i>Golden
Legend</i>. <i>Bach</i>, or Bache, is a word that had long escaped the
glossarists, with the exception of Dr. Whitaker, who says it is "a
Mereno-Saxon word, signifying <i>a bottom</i>, and that it enters into the
composition of several local names in the midland counties."</p>

<p>The passage in <i>Piers Ploughman</i>, upon which this is a gloss, occurs at
p. 119. of Whitaker's edition:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Ac ther was weye non so wys (that the way thider couthe</p>
      <p>Bote blostred forth as bestes) <i>over baches</i> and bulles."</p>

</div>

<p>The word occurs several times in <i>Layamon</i>, and on two occasions the
later text reads <i>slade</i>; in one passage we have it thus:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Of <i>dalen</i> and of <i>dunen</i></p>
    <p>  And of <i>bæcchen</i> deopen."<a id="Page_132"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[132]</span></p>

</div>

<p>The cognate languages would have led us to a different interpretation of
<i>Bache</i>. In Suevo-Gothic, <i>Backe</i> is "an ascent or descent, extremitas
montes, alias crepido vel ora." Wachter has <i>Backe</i>; collis, tumulus; of
which <i>Bühel</i>, collis clivus, is the diminutive still in use. In Swedish
<i>Backe</i>, and in Danish <i>Bakke</i>, is a hill or rising ground; and Ray, in
his <i>Travels</i>, has "a <i>baich</i>, or languet of land." There has probably
been some confusion here, as well as in the two similar words <i>dune</i> and
<i>dene</i>, for <i>hill</i> and <i>valley</i>.</p>

<p class="right">   S. W. S<span class="smcap lowercase">INGER</span>.</p>

<p>The legend of the sainted King Kenelm is related at great length, and
with very precise references to the various chroniclers in which it is
to be found, in the 1st vol. (pp. 721-4.) of MacCabe's <i>Catholic History
of England</i>. The Saxon couplet in which his death was announced at Rome
is very neatly rendered in Butler's <i>Lives of the Saints</i>:&mdash;</p>

<h3>
<span>ISABEL, QUEEN OF THE ISLE OF MAN.<br />
(Vol. iv., p. 423.)</span>
</h3>

<p>The lady about whom F<span class="smcap lowercase">ANNY</span> inquires, was the wife of William Lord
Fitz-Warine, who died in 35 Edward III. (1361), as to whom see <i>Dugd.
Bar.</i> i. 447. The register of interments and sepulchral inscriptions in
the church of the Grey Friars, London, printed in the fifth volume of
<i>Collectanea Topogr. et Geneal.</i> (the entry is at p. 278.), which I
presume to be the authority for the statement in Knight's <i>London</i>, does
not afford further information as to this lady, who is reckoned amongst
the four queens said by Weever (following Stowe) to have been interred
in this church. Mr. J. G. Nichols, in his note to the entry referred to,
does not add any information about the lady Isabel.</p>

<p>There was a Sybil, who was daughter of William Montacute, Earl of
Salisbury and King of Man and Derby, one of the most distinguished
characters in the heroic age of Edward III. She married Edmund, the
younger of the two sons of Edmund Earl of Arundel, by Alice, sister and
heir of John, last Earl of Warren and Surrey, who died in 1347 (<i>Dugd.
Bar.</i> i. 82.). William Montacute was created Earl of Salisbury 16th
March, 1337, and died in 1343, and was entombed in the church of the
Friars Carmelites, London (<i>Weever</i>, 437.). He was connected with the
family of John Earl of Surrey, for it appears from a grant made by the
king in 11 Edward III. to William Earl of Salisbury, that he was
entitled in reversion to certain hereditaments then held by John de
Warren, Earl of Surrey, and Joan his wife (<i>Collect. Top. et Gen.</i> vii.
379.). The valiant Montacute, lord of Man, did not die without heirs
male, for his son William was his heir; otherwise we might have supposed
the dominion of the isle to have devolved on his daughter Sybil or
Isabel, who, surviving Edmund her husband, may have married the Lord
Fitz-Warine. Can evidence of such connexion be found? I have not met
with anything to connect his family with the lordship of the Isle of
Man, and am not aware that "Isabel Queen of Man" is mentioned in any
record save the sepulchral register of the Grey Friars. I wish some clue
could be found to a satisfactory answer.</p>

<p>The other branch of the question proposed by F<span class="smcap lowercase">ANNY</span>, viz., when did the
Isle of Man cease to be an independent kingdom? can be answered by a
short historical statement. So early as the reign of John, its
sovereigns rendered fealty and homage to the kings of England. Reginald,
styled King of Man, did homage to Henry III., as appears by the extract
given from the <i>Rot. Pat.</i> 3 Hen. III., by Selden. During a series of
years previously, the kings of Man, who seem to have held this isle
together with the Hebrides, had done homage to the kings of Norway, and
its bishops went to Drontheim for consecration. Magnus, last sovereign
of Man of the Norwegian dynasty, died in 1265. From that period the
shadowy crown of Man is seen from time to time resting on lords of
different races, and its descent is in many periods involved in great
obscurity. After the death of Magnus, the island was seized by Alexander
III. of Scotland. A daughter and heiress of Reginald sued for it against
John Baliol before Edward I. of England as lord paramount of Man (<i>Rot.
Parl.</i> 31 Edw. I.). In 35 Edw. I., we find Anthony Bek, the warlike
Bishop and Count Palatine of Durham, in possession of the isle; but the
king of England then claimed to resume it into his own hands, as of the
ancient right of the crown. Accordingly, from sundry records it appears
that Edw. II. and Edw. III. committed its custody to various persons,
and the latter king at length conferred his right to it upon William
Montacute, Earl of Salisbury, in consideration, probably, of that
valiant Earl having by his arms regained the island from the Scots, who
had resumed possession, and of the circumstance that his grandmother,
the wife of Simon de Montacute, was sister and heiress of one of the
former kings of Man, and related to the lady who had claimed it as her
inheritance on the death of Magnus. The son and heir of the grantee sold
the isle to Scrope, Earl of Wiltshire, about 16 Rich. II. In the time of
Hen. IV., Sir William Scrope forfeited his possessions (<i>Dugd. Bar.</i> ii.
250.); and the isle again came to the crown. It was granted to Percy,
Earl of Northumberland, by the service of bearing the Lancaster sword on
the left shoulder of the king on the day of coronation; was forfeited by
Percy; and was thereupon granted by the same king to Sir John Stanley
and his heirs, under which grant the Earls of Derby succeeded<a id="Page_133"></a>
 <span class="pagenum">[133]</span>
during many years. It was a subject of a grant to the Stanleys by Queen
Elizabeth, and of an act of parliament in the reign of James I., under
which the isle became vested in the Duchess Dowager of Athol, as heir of
the body of James, seventh Earl of Derby, and ultimately became vested
by purchase in the crown. It may be said that during the time of
authentic history, the Isle of Man was not an independent kingdom, until
the regality was granted by the crown, as already mentioned.</p>

<h3>
<span>LONG MEG OF WESTMINSTER.<br />
(Vol. ii., pp. 131. 172.)</span>
</h3>

<p>When I wrote my note upon <i>Long Meg of Westminster</i>, I was not aware of
the following passage in Fuller's <i>Worthies</i> (Westminster, edit. 1662,
p. 236.):</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "<i>As long as Megg of Westminster.</i>&mdash;This is applyed to persons
   very tall, especially if they have <i>hop-pole-height</i>, wanting
   <i>breadth</i> proportionable thereunto. That such a <i>gyant-woman</i>
   ever was in Westminster, cannot be proved by any good witness (I
   pass not for a late lying <i>pamphlet</i>), though some in proof
   thereof produce her gravestone on the <i>south-side</i> of the
   <i>cloistures</i>, which (I confess) is as long, and large, and entire
   <i>marble</i> as ever I beheld. But be it known, that no <i>woman</i> in
   that age was interred in the <i>cloistures</i>, appropriated to the
   sepultures of the <i>abbot</i> and his <i>monkes</i>. Besides, I have read
   in the records of that <i>Abby</i> of an infectious year, wherein many
   monkes dyed of the <i>plague</i>, and were all buried in one grave;
   probably in this place, under this <i>marble monument</i>. If there be
   any truth in the proverb, it rather relateth to a great gun,
   lying in the tower, commonly call'd <i>Long Megg</i>; and in
   troublesome times (perchance upon <i>ill May day</i> in the raigne of
   King <i>Henry</i> the eighth), brought to <i>Westminster</i>, where for a
   good time it continued. But this <i>Nut</i> (perchance) deserves not
   the cracking."</p>

<p>Grose, in his <i>Provincial Glossary</i>, inserts among the <i>Local Proverbs</i>,
"As Long as Megg of Westminster," with the following note:&mdash;</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"This is applied to very tall slender persons. Some think it
   alluded to a long gun, called Megg, in troublesome times brought
   from the tower to Westminster, where it long remained. Others
   suppose it to refer to an old fictitious story of a monstrous
   tall virago called Long Megg of Westminster, of whom there is a
   small penny history, well known to school-boys of the lesser
   sort. In it there are many relations of her prowess. Whether
   there ever was such a woman or not, is immaterial; the story is
   sufficiently ancient to have occasioned the saying. Megg is there
   described as having breadth in proportion to her height. Fuller
   says, that the large grave-stone shown on the south side of the
   cloister in Westminster Abbey, said to cover her body, was, as he
   has read in an ancient record, placed over a number of monks who
   died of the plague, and were all buried in one grave; that being
   the place appointed for the sepulture of the abbots and monks, in
   which no woman was permitted to be interred."&mdash;Edit. 1811, p.
   207.</p>

<p>I shall not enter into the question, as to whether any "tall woman" of
"bad repute" was or was not buried in the cloisters of Westminster, as
it is very likely to turn out, upon a little inquiry, that the
<i>original</i> "long Meg" was a "great gun," and not a creature of flesh and
blood.</p>

<p>"Long Meg" is also the name of a large gun preserved in the castle of
Edinburgh; and, what is somewhat extraordinary, the great bombard forged
for the siege of Oudenarde, in 1382, now in the city of Ghent, is called
by the towns-people "Mad Meg."</p>

<p>A series of stones, situated upon an eminence on the east side of the
river Eden, near the village of Little Salkeld, are commonly known as
"Long Meg and her Daughters."</p>

<p>These notices, at any rate, are suggestive, and may be the means of
elucidating something perhaps more worth the knowing.</p>

<h3>
<span>THE INTRODUCTION OF STOPS, ETC.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 1.)</span>
</h3>

<p>My enquiry into the use of stops in the early days of typography will,
if it prove nothing else, show that the <i>Tablet of Memory</i> is not an
authority to be depended upon on that subject. I have arranged the
authorities which I have consulted in chronological order.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">1480. <i>Epistola F. Philelphi ad Sextum IV.</i>, printed at Rome.</p>

<p class="blockquot"> 1493. Politian's Latin translation of <i>Herodian</i>, printed at
   Bologna.</p>

<p>In both these books the colon and period are used, but neither the comma
nor semicolon.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> 1523. <i>Dialogi Platonis</i>, printed at Nuremberg.</p>


<p>Here I find the comma and period, and also the note of interrogation,
but not the colon or semicolon.</p>

   <p class="blockquot">1523. <i>Ascensius declynsons, with the playne Expositor</i>, without
   date, place, or printer's name.</p>

<p>This publication is ascribed by Johnson to Wynkyn de Worde, and
therefore printed between 1493 and 1534. I find in it the following
amusing passage relative to the ancient art of punctuation:&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"<i>Of the Craft of Poynting.</i></p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "There be fiue maner poynts, and divisions most uside with
   cunnyng men: the which, if they be wel usid, make the sentens
   very light, and esy to understond both to the reder and the

   poynt, and interrogatif. A <i>virgil</i> is a sclender stryke: lenynge

<p>It is evident that what the writer of this book calls the <i>virgil</i>, is
our comma: and his <i>come</i>, our colon. There is nothing, however,
allusive to our semicolon.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> 1541. Cranmer's <i>Bible</i>. Here we find the comma, colon, and
   period, and also the note of interrogation, but not the

  <p class="blockquot">1597. Gerard's <i>Herbal</i> contains the comma, colon, semicolon, and
   period.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> 1604. First part of Shakspeare's <i>Henry IV.</i>, 4to. Here the

  <p class="blockquot">1631. Baker's <i>Well-spring of Science</i> also uses the comma,
   colon, and period, but not the semicolon.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">1636. Record's <i>Ground of Arts</i>. Here all the stops now in use
   are found.</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> 1639. Cockeram's <i>English Dictionary</i> defines the comma, colon,
   and period, but not the semicolon. The latter, however, is <i>used</i>
   in the preface.</p>

  <p class="blockquot">1650. Moore's <i>Arithmetic</i> employs all the four common stops.</p>

   <p class="blockquot">1670. Blount's <i>Glossographia</i> defines the four common stops.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, the stops now in use may be found in books from
about 1630. So much concerning punctuation.</p>

<p>&mdash;It is a
well-known fact that the proud Duke of Somerset, and Prince George, his
successor as a Knight of the Garter, occupied the space between 1684 and
1820. The anecdote, however, related of George IV. by your intelligent
correspondent C. cannot be correct, because <i>the blue ribbon was
conferred upon Lord Moira by the Prince Regent in June, 1812</i>, who
advanced him in 1816 to the Marquisate of Hastings, <i>and George III. did
not die till 1820</i>. The story, therefore, must belong to the period of
the Regency, and not to the commencement of the reign of George IV.</p>

<p class="right">  B<span class="smcap lowercase">RAYBROOKE</span>.</p>

<p class="left">  Audley End.</p>


<p>There is some error in the statement of C. George IV. succeeded to the
throne 29th January, 1820, and the vacancy in the Order of the Garter
occasioned by his accession he gave to the Marquess of Buckingham, who
was elected 12th June that year. The Earl of Moira was elected and
invested in 1812, upon the vacancy created by the death of William,
fifth Duke of Devonshire, and was the third knight made during the
Regency. (See Beltz's <i>Succession of the Knights</i>, pp. ccxi. and ccxiv.)
Lord Moira never occupied the stall of George IV., which before his
accession was that of Prince of Wales.</p>

<p>At the time of the death of the Duke of Somerset, in 1748, there were
several vacancies; and on the 22d June, 1749, George Prince of
Brunswick, afterwards King George III., was elected in the room of John
Earl Powlett, and John Earl Granville was elected in the room of the
Duke of Somerset. (See <i>Beltz</i>, cciii.)</p>

<p>&mdash;I am able to afford your
correspondent F. R<span class="smcap lowercase">USSELL</span> but little information respecting Dr. John Ash;
but that is authentic, being taken from an entry in his own handwriting
in the Admission Book of Trinity College. It is to the following effect:</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"Ego Joannes Ash, Fil Josephi Ash, gen. (generosi) de Coventria

   magistri Geering 4<span class="topnum">o</span> Die Martii, 1739-40."</p>

may be presumed this is the same person.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I find by the corrected list of Oxford graduates, just published,
that Dr. Ash took his degrees of B.A. Oct. 21, 1743; M.A. Oct. 17, 1746;
B.M. Dec. 6, 1750; D.M. July 3, 1754.</p>

<p>&mdash;The words "Inveni portum" remind me
of Byron's answer to a friend, who claimed his congratulations upon
receiving a valuable appointment; "for," said he, "I may now say with
truth, 'Portum inveni.'" "I am very glad to hear it," replied Byron,
"for you have finished many bottles of mine."</p>

<p>&mdash;Thanks to your sensible correspondent A.
E. B.! A <i>true poet</i> always puts the right word in the right place, and
A. E. B.'s good taste assured him of Goldsmith's propriety.</p>

<p>We have it upon record, that Burke asked Goldsmith what he meant by the
word "slow," in the first line of his <i>Traveller</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Remote, unfriended, melancholy, <i>slow</i>."</p>

</div>

<p>"Do you mean, Dr. Goldsmith, <i>tardiness of locomotion</i>?" "Yes," said
Goldsmith. "No!" said Johnson, "you mean no such thing, Sir. You mean
<i>vacuity of action</i>."</p>

<p>A <i>true</i> poet ever puts the <i>right</i> word in the <i>right</i> place. A. E. B.
has put the argument rightly, and it is to be regretted that he has been
<i>obliged</i> to do so. To alter a word of Goldsmith's, is to gild refined
gold.</p>

<span><i>Church, whence derived</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 79.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;<i>Theophilus Anglicanus</i>
supplies a sufficient answer to M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. G<span class="smcap lowercase">EORGE</span> S<span class="smcap lowercase">TEPHENS'</span> inquiries
respecting the word <i>church</i>.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt about its etymology. The only question of
difficulty seems to be, <i>why</i> did the church of Rome adopt the word <span title="[Greek: ekklêsia]">&#7952;&#954;&#954;&#955;&#951;&#963;&#8055;&#945;</span> from
 the Greeks, and <i>not</i>
 <span title="[Greek: kyriakê]">&#954;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#8052;</span>? Was it
that they had a word of their own, viz. <i>Dominica</i>? or was it, that
<i>ecclesia</i> was already a naturalised word? However this may be, Dr.
Wordsworth bases upon the fact an important argument, tending to show
that the <i>Britons</i> did not receive their christianity in the first
instance from Rome:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "We may appeal," he says (Part <span class="smcap lowercase">II</span>. chap. ii.), "to the English
   word <i>church</i>, which is derived, as has been before said, from
   the Greek <span title="[Greek: kyriakê]">&#954;&#965;&#961;&#953;&#945;&#954;&#8052;</span>, a term which no Roman ever applied to
   the church (which he called <i>ecclesia</i>, and by no other name);
   and it is not credible, that, if the British church had been
   derived from Rome, it should have been designated by a title
   alike foreign to Romans and to Britons themselves."</p>

<p>If this argument be of any value in relation to <i>Britain</i>, it (of
course) would not be without its worth to those who ascribe the primary
conversion of the Teutonic countries, which M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>.
  S<span class="smcap lowercase">TEPHENS</span> mentions, to
 the early British and Irish missionaries.</p>

<span><i>Cross-legged Effigies</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 382.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;W. H. K. inquires for the
latest known example of a cross-legged effigy. The latest I have met
with is the very beautiful slab at Norton-Brize, Oxfordshire, to Sir
John Daubigné. He appears in plate armour of the earliest kind, and
wears the camail, and is surrounded by an inscription, with the date
1346. It is engraved by Skelton, and there is also an admirable woodcut
of it in Boutell's <i>Christian Monuments</i>, part ii. p. 141., a work of
which the continuation is much to be desired. That this monument was not
put down in Sir John Daubigné's lifetime, and the date of his death
filled up afterwards, is evident from the perfect correspondence of the
costume with the date of 1346. But it is probably the last example left
us of the cross-legged position, and even then out of fashion.</p>

<p>&mdash;I well remember to have seen
this before, in one of the multiplied editions of his <i>Colloquies</i> which
I cannot directly indicate. M. Ménage could not recollect, he says, the
name of the author<a id="hor1"></a><a title="Go to footnote 1." href="#fn1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> of the following singular epigram on the same
celebrated writer's character and name:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Hic jacet Erasmus, qui quondam bonus erat mus:</p>

<p class="noindent">This distich, it has been remarked, presents two obvious faults of
prosodial quantity; the first syllable of <i>bonus</i> being made long, and
the first of <i>vermibus</i> short, which the author explained by maintaining
that the one nullified and compensated for the other, thus redeeming
both.</p>

<p>The best epitaph on Erasmus has always appeared to me to be that of
Julius Cæsar Scaliger, expressive of his regret for their long personal
hostility, and then rendering ample justice to his deceased adversary.
It begins thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Tunc etiam moreris? ah quid me linquis, Erasme?</p>
      <p>Ante meus quam sit conciliatus amor!"</p>

words, "Vidit, pervidit, risit."</p>

<span><i>General Wolfe</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iv., p. 439.).</span>

<p>&mdash;To the inquiries of &#540;. relative
to General Wolfe, I can only answer that the northern English county to
which his ancestor, Captain George Woulfe, made his escape in 1651 from
Ireton's proscription, was understood to be Yorkshire. After his
expatriation and change of religion, the family in Clare lost, in a
great measure, sight of him and of his descendants, until, like
Epaminondas and Nelson, crowned with victory and glory at his death.</p>

may be advantageously applied to the explanation<a id="Page_137"></a>

and English superstition. Aubrey tells us, that "when any Christian is
drowned in the river Dee, there will appear over the water where the

to this day believe that the body of a secretly buried person may be
discovered by the lambent blue flame which hovers round the grave at
night.</p>

<p>&mdash;As none of your

<i>Childe Harold</i>, I may now tell you that the phrase is an orientalism
for "traveller," in allusion to their early rising to avoid the heat of
the mid-day sun. Lord Byron invites the traveller to visit the ruins of
Greece, but not to molest them as some former travellers had done; then
he turns upon Lord Elgin, and attacks him for his misdeeds in that way.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Haberdasher</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. ii., pp. 167. 253.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In Todd's edition of Johnson's
<i>Dictionary</i>, the word <i>haberdasher</i> is derived from <i>berdash</i>, which is
said "to have been a name formerly used in England for a certain kind of
neck-dress, whence the maker or seller of such clothes was called a
<i>berdasher</i>; and thence comes <i>haberdashers</i>." This etymology is hardly
admissible. Can an early reference be given to the use of the term
<i>berdash</i>, as an article of dress? Minsheu, Todd remarks, ingeniously
deduces it from <i>Habt ihr dass</i>, German, <i>Have you this?</i> the expression
of a shopkeeper offering his wares to sell. But the derivation of the
term <i>haberdasher</i> furnished by your correspondent (Vol. ii., p. 253.)
is certainly the most satisfactory.</p>

<p>At the end of the sixteenth century (about 1580) the shopkeepers that
went under this designation dealt largely in most of the minor articles
of foreign manufacture; and among the "haberdashery" of that period were
"daggers, swords owches, broaches, aiglets, Spanish girdles, French
cloths, Milan caps, glasses, painted cruizes, dials, tables, cards,
balls, puppets, ink-horns, tooth-picks, fine earthen pots, pins and
points, hawks' bells, salt-cellars, spoons, knives, and tin dishes." A
yet more curious list of goods vended by the "milloners or haberdashers"
who dwelt at the Royal Exchange within two or three years after it had
been built, occurs in Stow's <i>Annals</i> by Howe (p. 869.), where we are
informed that they "sould mouse-trappes, bird-cages, shooing-hornes,
lanthornes, and Jew's trumpes."</p>

<p>The author of that curious tract, <i>Maroccus Extaticus</i>, 1595 (which I
reprinted in the Percy Society) speaks of a "felow" loading his sleeve
with "fuel from the <i>haberdashers</i>."</p>

<p>The more ancient name of these traders was <i>milainers</i>, an appellation
derived from their dealing in merchandize chiefly imported from the city
of Milan. They were also, I believe, called <i>hurrers</i>, from dealing in
hats and caps.</p>

<p>It is evident, from the above, that "a retailer of goods, a dealer in
small wares," is the true meaning of the word <i>haberdasher</i>.</p>

<span><i>Vincent Kidder</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 502.).</span>

<p>&mdash;The ancestors of this personage
resided at a house called the "Hole," in the parish of Maresfield. In
the time of Henry VII., and earlier, they held the office of bailiffs of
the Forest of Ashdown, otherwise called Lancaster Great Park. I believe
that most of the existing families of Kidder are branches of this parent
stock. From a branch long settled at Lewes sprang Dr. Kidder, Bishop of
Bath and Wells, who lost his life in the great storm of 1703. I believe
that the Irish branch had previously been settled in London. A third
branch settled in the American colonies in the seventeenth century, and
has produced a highly respectable and wealthy progeny still resident in
the New England states, and elsewhere. I have at hand materials for a
complete pedigree of the Sussex or elder line of the family, down to the
time of its extinction. Perhaps your correspondent will communicate with
me on this subject by a private letter.</p>

<span><i>Monody on the Death of Sir John Moore</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. i., p. 445.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;If any
person entertains a doubt that the Rev. Charles Wolfe was the author, I
trust that the following statement will have the effect of removing it.
In the October number of the <i>Dublin University Magazine</i>, 1851, there
is a short biographical notice of the late much lamented Rev. Samuel
O'Sullivan, which contains the following passage:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"One of his intimate acquaintances was Charles Wolfe. The
   exquisite lines on the burial of Sir John Moore were suggested by
   O'Sullivan reading to him the description in the <i>Annual
   Register</i> of the retreat from Corunna. Immediately after, the two
   friends went out to wander in the fields. During their ramble
   Wolfe was silent and moody. On their return to their College
   chambers he repeated the first and last stanzas of the ode that
   has made his name immortal."</p>

<p>Knowing the source from which this assertion emanates, I have no reason
to suspect the veracity of the writer.</p>

<p>There is an additional proof, which is well worthy of being recorded in
your pages, and of which I have had ocular demonstration. In the <i>Royal
Irish Academy</i> there is an original letter, framed, in the handwriting
of Wolfe, of which I send you an exact <i>fac-simile</i>. You will perceive
that it contains a copy of the poem, and that his signature is attached
to it, I need not add any more.</p>

   at one birth the first time; <i>and he being troubled at it</i>,
   travelled, and was absent seven years. After his returne, she was
   <i>delivered of seven children at one birth</i>. In this parish is a
   confident tradition that these seven children were all baptized
   at the font in this church, and that they were brought thither in
   a kind of chardger, which was dedicated to this church, and hung
   on two nailes, which are to be seen there yet, neer the belfree

<p>In the reign of Elizabeth, the <i>handruffs</i> are seen pleated and edged
with rich lace; and in the three succeeding reigns, they were generally
worn of fine lawn or cambric. When the Hanoverian race ascended the
English throne, many changes took place in the national costume; but the
<i>ruffle</i> was retained, and continued during the century.</p>

<p>Some of your readers may recollect the print of Garrick's Macbeth, with
cocked hat of the last London cut, bag-wig, full court dress and
<i>ruffles</i>!</p>

<p>In 1762, the rage for large ruffles was beginning to decline. A writer
in the <i>London Chronicle</i> for that year (p. 167.) says (speaking of the
gentlemen's dress):&mdash;</p>

  <p class="blockquot">"Their cuffs cover entirely their wrists, and only the <i>edge of
   their ruffles</i> are to be seen; as if they lived in the slovenly
   days of Lycurgus, when every one was ashamed to show clean
   linen."</p>

<p>The French Revolution of 1789 very much influenced the English fashions
in costume; the cocked-hat and ruffles were discarded to make room for
the ugly "round hat" and "small cuffs" of the Parisian butchers.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to fix upon the period for the total disuse of any
particular fashion. Fashions of a "hundred years ago" may still be seen
in some of our country churches; and I should not be surprised to find
<i>ruffles</i> among their number.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Allen of Rossull</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 11.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;There seems some little doubt
about the arms of Allen of Rossull. A MS. at Burton Constable,
Yorkshire, gives the following as the arms of the family:&mdash;Allen,
Ross<i>all</i> (not Ross<i>ull</i>, though sometimes Rushall, Rossal, &amp;c.):
argent, a chevron engrailed azure, between three griffins' heads erased;
on a chief of the second an anchor, or, between two bezants.</p>

<p>The windows of Ushaw College, Durham, however, frequently present a coat
far different from this, surmounted by a cardinal's hat. The arms there
are Argent, a cross gules for the college of Douay;&mdash;impaling for the
founder, William Allen, argent, three conies in pale sejant, sable. The
first seems to have belonged to the family; the last&mdash;if assumed by the
cardinal himself&mdash;seem singularly indicative of his peculiar propensity
for endeavouring to undermine sound doctrine by his heretical works and
acts.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Serjeants' Rings</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., pp. 59. 92. 110.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The happiest motto
which comes to my recollection is that adopted by the first serjeants
who were called after the decision of the Court of Common Pleas in
January, 1840, overturning the warrant issued by King William IV., which
opened the court to all members of the bar. Five new serjeants were then
called, who gave rings with this motto, in allusion to the restoration
of their rights:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Honor nomenque manebunt."</p>

</div>

<p>Is your correspondent E. N. W. right as to Serjeant Onslow's motto? As
all the serjeants called at the same time have the same motto inscribed
on the rings they respectively give, it is not likely, if others were
joined in the same call with him, that a motto should have been adopted
which applied only to one of the number. If indeed he happened to be
called alone, it is possible he may have used it; but I am inclined to
think E. N. W. has confounded the motto <i>of the family</i> with that of the
serjeant.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Clerical Members of Parliament</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 11.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;John Horne Tooke,
the reformer, who was in priest's orders, having been presented to the
borough of Old Sarum by Lord Camelford, in February, 1801, an act was
passed (41. Geo. III. c. 73.) to exclude the clergy from parliament; but
as it did not vacate the seat of any member then elected, Mr. Tooke
remained in the house till the dissolution in June, 1802. In the course
of the debate, the case of Mr. Edward Rushworth, member for Newport, in
the Isle of Wight, in 1784, was referred to. He was in deacon's orders,
and a petition presented against his return, but was allowed to retain
his seat. He is supposed to have been one of the <i>two</i> ministers of the
Church of England alluded to by Sir James Johnstone in his speech in the
debate on the Test and Corporation Acts, 8th May, 1789, as then being
members of the House.</p>

<p>&mdash;The following extract from a curious
book in my possession, entitled <i>Theophania; or severall Modern
Histories represented by way of Romance</i> (see "N. &amp; Q." Vol. i., p.
174.), shows a much earlier use of this word than that of Burnet's. The
date of <i>Theophania</i> is 1655:</p>

   <p class="blockquot"> "He was at length taken prisoner, and, as a sure token of an
   entire victory, sent with a strong guard into <i>Sicily</i>; where
   <i>Glaucus</i> and <i>Pausanias</i>, fearing time might mitigate the

 <span class="pagenum">[140]</span> be presently
   dispatched; and the judges, being all of the same Cabal, without

<span><i>Latin Verse on Franklin</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 443.; Vol. v., p. 17.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The
line on Franklin&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"Eripuit c&oelig;lo fulmen, sceptrumque tyrannis,"</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">was written by Turgot, Louis XVI.'s minister and controller-general of
finance. This verse, however, so happily applied to the American
philosopher and statesman's double title to renown, is merely the
modification of one in the <i>Anti-Lucretius</i> of Cardinal Polignac, the
37th of the first book, "Eripuitgue Jovi fulmen, Ph&oelig;boque sagittas,"
which again had for its model that of Marcus Manilius, a poet of the
Augustan age. It is the 104th of his <i>Astronomicon</i>, where he says of
Epicurus (lib. v.), "Eripuitque Jovi fulmen, viresque Tonanti." This
appears to be the original source of the phrase, so far as I could trace
it. Turgot, though highly appreciated by his sovereign, and promoted to
the prime ministry in consequence, was only suffered to hold the
responsible situation for a short time, from August, 1774, to May, 1776,
when he fell a sacrifice to court intrigues, which the weak king had not
the energy to resist, while emphatically saying, "Il n'y a que Turgot et
moi qui aimions le peuple." This eminent statesman's advocacy of the
freedom of commerce, state economy, and general liberty of the subject,
exposed him not only to courtly but to popular hostility. The French
were certainly ill prepared for such innovations on their policy or
habits, nor, I may add, even now, notwithstanding the constantly
alternating schemes of government, from despotic to constitutional, in
the long interposed period, do they appear fully to appreciate, or
anxious to introduce these desirable improvements.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Job</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 26.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The Rev. T. R. B<span class="smcap lowercase">ROWNE</span> interprets one of the
Persepolitan inscriptions as representing the coronation and titles of
Job. As no previous commentator had supposed Job to be a Persian prince,
and as (among other unexpected results) it would follow that the poem
bearing his name was a translation into Hebrew by some unknown hand, I
hastened at once to the Bodleian to examine the authorities on which
M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">ROWNE</span> bases his interpretation.</p>

<p>On one glance at the work cited (<i>Kaempferi Am&oelig;nitatum Exoticarum
Fasciculi V.</i>) it was plain enough that Kaempfer had made his
transcription so carelessly, that barely <i>one letter in a hundred</i> was
correct; and, on turning to Niebuhr's copy of the same inscription
(plate xxiv. <span class="smcap lowercase">A</span>.), and to Porter's (vol. i. plate xliv. p. 631.), my
suspicions were amply confirmed. But the most singular part was to come.
Aided by the minute identifications which M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. B<span class="smcap lowercase">ROWNE</span> gives of the words
which he translates, <i>Aiub taij</i>, I discovered that the reverend
gentleman had mistaken two letters for two words. His whole theory,
therefore, falls to the ground.</p>

<p>As some of your readers may like to know the real interpretation of this
inscription, I give the translation of Rawlinson as amended from
Westergaard's notes, and which is undoubtedly correct:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "The great God Ormazd, who has given this world, who has given
   that heaven, who has given mankind, who has given life to
   mankind; who has made Xerxes king, both the king of the people,
   and the law-giver of the people. I am Xerxes the king, the great
   king, the king of kings, the king of many-peopled countries, the
   supporter also of this great world, the son of King Darius the
   Achæmenian," &amp;c.</p>

but it does not at all afford the information I seek. My Query referred
to the <i>original</i> sale in London of the gems. Lord Monson's collection,

<span><i>Sleck Stone, Meaning of</i></span>
<span> (Vol. iii., p. 241.; Vol. iv., p. 394.).</span>

<p>&mdash;The
expression <i>sleck-stone</i> has, I think twice, been spoken of in "N. &amp; Q."
as equivalent to whet-stone: this is a mistake. The first word is
possibly misprinted in the work in which it is found, but at all events
the thing intended is a <i>sleek-stone</i> (Old Fr. <i>Calendrine</i>) an
implement formerly used by calendrers; often, if not always, made of
glass, and in shape much like a large mushroom: it is used reversed, the
stalk forming the handle. Those which I have seen were about four inches
in diameter, some more and some less. Sleek-stones are now, I believe,
entirely superseded by machinery.</p>

</h4>

<p>&mdash;Living near the Forest of Dean, I wish
to state that it is not known that any trees exist there which can
possibly be of anything approaching to the age of Edward III.; that the
word <i>forbid</i> savours of a reservation of timber for the use of the
mines, if the privileges of the free-miners can really be carried back
to that time. The intelligence in Pepys was derived from Sir John
Winter, the person who bought the whole forest in perpetuity from
Charles I., but was allowed by Charles II. only to make the most of it
he could in his own time. Some trees may have survived the smash which
he made, but they must either have been young, or worthless from age or
decay.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Objective and Subjective</i> </span>

<p>&mdash;I would beg to refer X.
to the first of the five <i>Sermons</i> by W. H. Mill, D.D., preached before
the University of Cambridge, in Lent, 1844. When he has carefully
perused it, he will be enlightened as to the precise meaning of the
terms <i>objective</i> and <i>subjective</i>; being made aware that there is one
great <i>object</i> of faith, though, with some writers, the <i>subject</i>, man,
may be made the most prominent. X. will there find that what he styles
"exoteric jargon" has, in the hands of so judicious a writer and so
excellent a divine as Dr. Mill, been "translated into intelligible
English."</p>

<p>&mdash;I am sorry not to be able to
agree with M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">HADWICK</span> in thinking "that no fee is legally payable for
searching the register-books of baptisms and burials, nor even for
making a copy," &amp;c. It is quite certain that even parishioners have no
<i>right</i> to inspect the parish books, except for ordinary parochial
purposes. In the case of Rex <i>v.</i> Smallpiece, 2 Chitt. <i>Rep.</i> 288., Lord
Tenterden said, "I know of no rule of law which requires the parish
officers to show the books, in order to gratify the curiosity of a
private individual." Therefore the "genealogical or archæological
inquirer" has in general no <i>right</i> to inspect, much less copy the
register-books: consequently he must pay the fees demanded for being
allowed to do so.</p>

<p>&mdash;I doubt whether your correspondent J.

His rendering <i>buxom</i> by <i>womanly</i> will hardly stand the test of
criticism. In the old matrimonial service, as elsewhere, it originally
signified <i>obedient</i>, <i>compliant</i>, and was equivalent to the German
<i>biegsam</i>. It was applied indifferently to men and women. Thus, in
Chaucer's <i>Shipmanne's Tale</i>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>"They wolden that hir <i>husbondes</i> shulden be</p>

<p>Murray's <i>Official Handbook of Church and State, containing the Names,
Duties, and Powers of the principal Civil, Military, Judicial, and
Ecclesiastical Authorities of the United Kingdom and Colonies; with
Lists of the Members of the Legislature, Peers, Baronets, &amp;c.</i>, is, as
to its objects, sufficiently described by its ample title-page. An
examination of its pages will show the great amount of information
illustrative of the rise, nature, and peculiar duties of the numerous
branches of the executive government of this vast empire, which the
editor justly claims the credit of having sought for from various
sources, and now for the first time gathered together. It must soon,
therefore, find its way on to the desks of all men in office&mdash;not indeed
as superseding the old Red Books and Official Calendars&mdash;but as an
indispensable companion to them.</p>

<p>When speaking of the translation of Huc's <i>Travels in Tartary, Thibet,
and China</i>, which we noticed some few weeks since, we gave our readers
the best possible evidence of the value of the work. That Messrs.
Longman have done wisely in including a condensed translation of these
interesting <i>Recollections of a Journey through Tartary, Thibet, and
China</i>, from the practised pen of Mrs. Percy Sinnett, in their
<i>Traveller's Library</i>, we cannot therefore doubt; and we shall be much
surprised if the book does not prove to be one of the most popular in
the admirable series of which it forms the 14th and 15th Parts.</p>

<p>By way of answering the inquiry of a correspondent, and for the purpose
of forwarding the very admirable and important objects of <i>The

which has been circulated by its projectors, and have inserted it in
full in our advertising columns.</p>

<p class="center larger">ADDRESS</p>
     <p class="center smaller"> OF THE</p>
   <p class="center x-large">   CHRONOLOGICAL INSTITUTE</p>
   <p class="center larger">   OF LONDON.</p>

<p>In the present state of human knowledge, there are few sciences in which
so great difficulties appear, or so great differences of opinion
prevail, among the principal authors who have treated of it, as in
Chronology. It hath been justly styled "one of the eyes" of History: yet
its vision is indistinct, with regard to many of its most important
objects. So far as it is a mathematical science, it is capable of the
utmost exactness; but the historical data, on which its calculations
must depend, are not yet sufficiently ascertained and collected for that
purpose. Hence the imperfect and unsatisfactory state of this useful
science.</p>

<p>The application of the principle of the division of labour hath caused
the establishment of various societies, for the special cultivation and
promotion of distinct branches of science. Among these, Geography, "the
other eye" of History, hath long enjoyed the advantage of a public
institution. Astronomy also, which more than any other science, except
History, is connected with Chronology, hath obtained the like
distinction; notwithstanding the fact that the most important
discoveries of modern astronomers had been as by a peculiar prerogative,
communicated to the Royal Society, the noble parent of literary and
scientific societies in this country. Chronology indeed, if regarded as
a branch of historical science, finds a home in the institutions which
are devoted to archæology: but so far as it may be considered
mathematical, it meets with little or no attention among associated
antiquaries.</p>

<p>Although there exist numerous works, in every department of
Chronological inquiry, and in various languages, yet some few only of
them are generally known to chronological students. To collect, arrange,
and describe them is highly desirable: for the world hath not, as yet,
been presented with the bibliography of this science. Hence the
imperfections and errors which exist in the greater part of modern
publications on this subject.</p>

<p>To promote, therefore, a more comprehensive acquaintance with
chronological literature, and a more exact study of this science, both
historically and mathematically, as well as to establish a medium of
intercommunication among Chronologers and other studious and learned
persons throughout the world, and by such means to enlarge the compass
of comparative Chronology, this Institute hath been founded; and the
friendly co-operation is invited of all persons who are interested in
this science, whether their predilections be in favour of its
astronomical, or its antiquarian departments: in short, whether they be
Bibliographers, Critics, Historians, or Philosophers.</p>

<p>The Chronological Institute was founded at the winter solstice of 1850,
and already numbers among its Members, several Antiquaries, Astronomers,
Archivists, and Authors. The annual subscription is five shillings,
without at present any admission fee.</p>

<p>Ladies and gentlemen, desirous of becoming Ordinary Members, are
requested to send their names and address, with their literary,
scientific, or official descriptions, to any one of the officers, by
whom they will be duly laid before the council: and, if approved, their
election will be notified to them.</p>

<p>Eminent foreign scholars, and men of science, known to be conversant
with Chronology, will be requested to accept diplomas, and to render
their valuable aid by correspondence with the Institute.</p>

   <p class="center">CONSTITUTION AND OBJECT.</p>

<p>I. That the Chronological Institute of London shall consist of a
Treasurer, Secretary, and Registrar, and (when deemed expedient) of a
President; also of a Council, and other Members.</p>

<p>II. That the Members shall be either Ordinary or Honorary: the former
contributing to the support, and having a voice in the government of the
Institute; the latter not having such obligation.</p>

<p>III. That the object of the Institute shall be to promote Chronological
Science, by literary contributions, by collecting and diffusing
information, by interchange of correspondence, by lectures on Chronology
and its various branches and applications, and by the publication or
encouragement of Chronological works.</p>
